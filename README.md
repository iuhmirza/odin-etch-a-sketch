This is perhaps the project that I am most proud of. It synthesises all the commmon front-end use cases of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

When the page load a grid of `<div>s` is generated. These `pixels` are laid out using flexbox, with no gaps. The `pixels` are given an event listener which changes their class to a preselected colour, with the previous classes removed. Boards of different sizes can also be generated.
